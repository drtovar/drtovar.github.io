Syllabus
LA TK: Outsider Geographies
SCI-Arc: Spring 2025

Instructor: Daniel Tovar
TA: Solomon
Time:
Room:

**COURSE ABSTRACT**

From the hinterlands to the wilderness to outer space, the notion of an
other space has loomed large in the popular geographic imaginary. It
promises freedom and salvation, and also danger and damnation. But what
has led us to so consistently divide the landscape into inner and outer?
Why do we so fervently long for another world, life, and body? And why
have we so often insisted that it must be found out there --- in the
forest, the desert, on Mars?

In this course, we will survey these outsider geographies and their
depictions in film, photography, sound, and sculpture. Students will
think about how these outsider geographies can inform their own
representations of the landscape -- and also how to subvert them.
Students will embark on projects that visually and sonically represent
the landscape while also sharpening their representations through
writing.

**COURSE DESCRIPTION**

This course has two aims. First, it aims to give a multi-disciplinary
survey of media that imagine \"outsider\" geographies. Its second aim is
to help studends develop a practice that incorporates theory. It is an
exercise in using theory to push forward artistic projects and artistic
projects to help push forward understanding of theory.

**COURSE ORGANIZATION**

*Overview of how the course will be organized (different sections,
different instructors, etc). Themes, concepts, tools, and techniques
used. Teamwork used?  Etc.*

On the whole, the practical topics mentioned above --- visual, aural,
and writing --- will organize the broad structure of the course. On a
more granular level, each class will be organized around different
philosophical and literary texts.

**MATERIAL NEEDS**

We will have a field trip just after studio midterms. I will be renting
an Air BNB that we can all pitch in on.

**Note on Learning Objectives and Outcomes:** these are, respectively,
concrete intentions for the course and the abilities or understanding
that the students must demonstrate to pass the course. **Each of these
should be clearly evidenced by the graded assignments**. These can be
one per assignment, or several points that a big assignment or
multi-part assignment will demonstrably cover. These need to be phrased
as definite claims of what students will be able to do that describe
what they will do for the assignments. These are NOT course goals about
how the students will gain a command of an area of knowledge or how they
will hopefully understand the content discussed in the course. If the
students will learn a technique, software, etc., this should only be
mentioned here if the assignments will directly prove that they learned
this.

**Example learning outcomes:**
  
*Objective 1: The course will familiarize students with the discourse of contemporary art history.* 
*Outcome 1: Students will identify major art movements, works of art,
and art historical writings that structure the discourse of contemporary
art history (1945--present).* \
*Objective 2: The course will expose students to methods of analysis and
interpretation in the history of art.*\
*Outcome 2: Students will argue for an interpretation of an artwork
through formal and contextual analyses.*\
*Objective 3: The course will help students improve their professional
communication skills (NAAB A.1).*\
*Outcome 3: Through class discussions of assigned readings and various
written exercises, students will demonstrate speaking, reading, and
writing skills.*

**PROJECTS OVERVIEW**

There are four projects in this course each of which can be divided into
the following three categories: visual, sound, text. Project 1 and 2 are
visual. Project 3 will focus on sound. Project 4 will focus on text.

The deliverables

The skills developed in each project build on each other.

**TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES**

Photography, Sound Recording, Video, theory in practice

GRADING PROCEDURES

Grades will be determined based upon the meeting of student learning
objectives, quality of work produced, improvement over the course of the
semester, completion of project requirements, quality of participation,
attendance, attitude, and ethical conduct. SCI-Arc grading policies will
be discussed on the first day of class, and any questions regarding
grades or policies should be directed to the instructor and/or Lisa
Russo, the registrar. A passing grade in the course requires committed
completion of all projects. Incomplete work will not be evaluated. 

*From the SCI-Arc Student Handbook\_\_:* SCI-Arc employs a narrative
grading system, as follows: credit with distinction (CR+), credit (CR),
marginal credit (CR-), conditional credit (CCR), no credit (NC),
incomplete (I) and withdrawal (W). The grade of no credit (NC) is given
whenever cumulative work, final work, and/or attendance are
unsatisfactory. It is also given when a student fails to submit a final
project or fails to take a final examination without prior approval from
the instructor. No credit (NC) grades cannot be altered.

*GPA Equivalents:*

  Grade   Point Equivalent
  ------- ------------------
  CR+     4.0
  CR      3.35
  CR-     2.7
  CCR     2.0
  NC      0.0
  I       0.0
  W       0.0

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY *(from SCI-Arc Student Handbook)*

SCI-Arc takes issues of academic integrity seriously, including
plagiarism, which can occur in design classes as well as core and
elective classes. Some examples of plagiarism include:

-   Copying words, images, or other material without using quotation
    marks or other indications of the original source.
-   Paraphrasing another person's ideas in your own words without
    crediting the original source.
-   Taking sole credit for assignments without giving credit to those
    who worked with you.
-   Submitting work for a course that has already/also been submitted
    for another course.
-   Internet plagiarism, such as submitting work either found or paid
    for online, failing to cite any internet sources used, or cutting
    and pasting sentences from various websites to create a collage of
    uncited words.

Note: the academic integrity policy contains several tiers, depending on
the nature and extent of academic dishonesty involved and on whether the
student has committed an academic offense before. All cases *must* be
reported to the Academic Advisor and the report is added to the
student's academic record. Refer to the SCI-Arc Student Handbook for the
full academic integrity policy including what happens at various tiers,
right of appeal, and possible disciplinary outcomes.

ATTENDANCE POLICY *(from SCI-Arc Student Handbook)*

Any student who is absent without an acceptable excuse more than three
times during a fifteen-week term will receive a grade of no credit (NC)
for the course. Instructors may impose more stringent attendance
requirements and should make them clear at the beginning of the term. It
is legitimate for the instructor to view unexcused lateness or
departures from class as full absences. 

Examples of acceptable excused absences are the following:
medical/illness, observance of religious holiday, emergency leave,
bereavement due to death in immediate family, military duty, jury duty,
involvement in traffic accident, and court appearance.

INCOMPLETE WORK

A student may receive a grade of incomplete (I) by requesting permission
from the instructor prior to the date of the final examination or
presentation. Permission will be granted only under extraordinary
circumstances and usually for medical reasons. Incompletes must be
fulfilled to the satisfaction of the instructor no later than three (3)
weeks after the end of term. The student is responsible for providing
the instructor with the "Request for Credit" card used for this purpose.
This card must be signed by the instructor and returned to the
Registrar's office. Failure to do so will result in the incomplete (I)
being changed to a no credit (NC). No credit grades cannot be altered.

APPEAL OF A GRADE

Evaluation and grading of a student's performance in a course is based
upon the instructor's professional assessment of the academic quality of
the student's performance on a body of work. Such assessments are
nonnegotiable, and disputes about them do not constitute valid grounds
for an appeal. Students are encouraged to contact their instructor for
clarification regarding the grade received in their course. 

Grade appeals are rare and subject to appeal only for the following
three grounds: 

-   improper academic procedures that unfairly affect a student's
    grade. 
-   application of nonacademic criteria, such as: considerations of
    race, politics, religion, sex, or other criteria not directly
    reflective of performance related to course requirements. 
-   sexual harassment.

Students must meet with the Academic Advisor to review the appeal
process if they believe the grade received meets one or more of the
grounds listed above. Petitions must be settled, and a final grade
submitted to the registrar no later than six weeks after the end of the
term in which the course was completed.

ARCHIVING

The SCI-Arc Upload site is the school's official archive of each
semester's work. This is a mandatory requirement of each student's
coursework, and grades will not be submitted until work is uploaded.
This archive will be used for all future publications and graphic
material as well as for required accreditation needs of SCI-Arc.  

Archiving requirements may vary based on curricular and/or project
requirements. Specific instructions will be communicated to students
each semester.

OWNERSHIP OF WORK (*from SCI-Arc Student Handbook*)

Physical copies of student work submitted to the school to satisfy
course requirements including but not limited to digital files, papers,
drawings, and models become the property of the school. SCI-Arc shall
have no obligation to safeguard such materials and may, at its
discretion, retain them, return them to the student, or discard them.

Notwithstanding whether it retains any physical copies of such student
works, SCI-Arc shall have an irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide right
in perpetuity to use, reproduce, display, and exhibit works created by
students during their studies at SCI-Arc, in publications by or about
SCI-Arc, on its websites, on social media, or otherwise. SCI-Arc will
make a reasonable effort to credit the author(s) of student work
included in publications or other uses. Excepting works which are
created during a student's participation in a Sponsored Project, the
student shall have the right to publish or present their own work
without compensation to SCIArc. However, SCI-Arc must be informed of
this publication and appropriately credited in this publication or
presentation unless SCI-Arc requests not to be credited.

SUPPORTING MENTAL HEALTH

Diminished mental health, including significant stress, mood changes,
excessive worry, or problems with eating or sleeping can interfere with
optimal academic performance. Reducing stigma about accessing mental
health care supports students seeking professional help when it is
needed. SCI-Arc provides all students with two free counseling sessions
per year. Sessions are available two days per week throughout the fall
and spring terms, and one day per week during the summer term. All
counseling sessions are confidential. Only with your consent can any
details of your session be shared with another individual. Information
to schedule an appointment can be found on the Campus Life tab of
My.Sciarc.
