# Wk 1: Utopia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(book)

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Utopia.ortelius.jpg/300px-Utopia.ortelius.jpg)

In 1516, Sir Thomas More published a book in latin titled:

> _Libellus vere aureus, nec minus salutaris quam festivus, de optimo rei publicae statu deque nova insula
> Utopia_, "A truly golden little book, not less beneficial than enjoyable, about how things should be in a
> state and about the new island Utopia"

It is known today by the shorter title, *Utopia*.

> "_Utopia_ is derived from the Greek prefix "ou-" (οὔ), meaning "not", and _topos_ (τόπος), "place", with the
> suffix _-iā_ (-ίᾱ) that is typical of [toponyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toponym "Toponym"); the name
> literally means "nowhere", emphasizing its fictionality. In [early modern
> English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_English "Early modern English"), _Utopia_ was spelled
> "Utopie", which is today rendered _Utopy_ in some editions."
>
> In English, _Utopia_ is pronounced the same as _Eutopia_ (the latter word, in Greek Εὐτοπία [_Eutopiā_],
> meaning "good place," contains the prefix εὐ- [_eu-_], "good", with which the οὔ of _Utopia_ has come to be
> confused in the English pronunciation).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(book)#cite_note-5) That
> is something that More himself addresses in an addendum to his book: _Wherfore not Utopie, but rather
> rightely my name is Eutopie, a place of
> felicitie_.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(book)#cite_note-7)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki
> /Utopia_(book)#cite_note-8)

==TK: Discussion of pro and critical accounts of utopia==

> [!Question] Since More coined the term, there has been much discussion of utopia, both celebratory and
> critical. While these criticisms are interesting — in this course, we will not be particularly interested in
> either. Instead, we will focus on the following question: why is it that our envisioning of a *better* life,
> a *better* city, a *better* way of being has become so bound up with identifying this better life/city/self
> with an-other *place*?
